/* This is a wrapper for react-select. It provides styling compatible
 * with our app's design, at least in the context of forms. Styling
 * might not work for some fancy react-select's features, like multi-select,
 * but I didn't test those scenarios. So, keep that in mind if you decide
 * to reuse this component.
 *
 * Also, if you want to use this component inside a parent that has
 * the "overflow" css property set to auto/scroll, you probably want to
 * pass menuPosition prop set to "fixed". This will make sure your
 * dropdown doesn't get hidden below parent's boundaries, and stays on top.
 * An alternative would be to pass menuPortalTarget prop (likely set to "document.body")
 *
 * There is still a minor issue with select's menu not adjusting its
 * width on the fly when you resize window, but I think it's not critical:
 * it still gets resized as soon as you hover an option. Maybe forcing a
 * rerender on window's resize would do the trick.
 */

/* I was unhappy with the type of "value" prop that react-select expects (basically
 * you have to pass an object with "value" and "label" properties, but we only really
 * care about the value. Also, by default react-select doesn't seem to support
 * the classic "name" property, that is really helpful for identifying which
 * select changed inside a form. So, here is a custom wrapper for that.
 * Names of those props are not ideal, but that's because we can't override
 * ReactSelectProps' properties...
 * Doesn't support multi-selects as of now, would probably be best to allow
 * regular usage of react-select too for such scenarios, but it's not necessary yet.
