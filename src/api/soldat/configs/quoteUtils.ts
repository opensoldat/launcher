/* Soldat relies on Pascal's TStringList for parsing config files line by line.
 * TStringList has some fancy behavior for detecting strings inside strings, and
 * I don't really feel like rewriting their implementation in Javascript.
 * So, instead of that, we make the assumption that all strings in config files
 * (whether they contain one word, or many whitespace-separated words) will be
 * quoted with double-quote characters (").
 * Example:
 * '"bind" "ALT+S" "say Yeah"' => ['bind', 'ALT+S', 'say Yeah']
 *
 * Just like with TStringList, if we want to have a double-quote character inside
 * a quoted string, we need to add two double-quote characters next to each other.
 * Example:
 * '"bind" "ALT+O" "say ""Follow me"""' => ['bind', 'ALT+O', 'say "Follow me"']
 *
 * As for the reasoning behind all this stuff: initially, I thought it would be
 * enough to split all lines from config files with some whitespace character as
 * separator. I was pretty confident that only the action in "bind" command would
 * contain whitespace characters, and so when parsing config files, I thought I
 * could just extract the first two words ("bind" and the chosen key, like "ALT+S"),
 * and treat the rest of the line as "bind" command's action. I was proven wrong when
 * testing key bindings that contain spaces, like:
 * bind "Keypad 8" "say test"
 * Thus I realized that splitting config lines by whitespaces isn't really a great
 * solution, and decided to move to this other approach, which provides more
 * compatibility between launcher and Soldat itself.
