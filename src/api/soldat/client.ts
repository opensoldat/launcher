/* At first glance, it doesn't seem like Soldat supports connecting
 * by hostname anymore, so we only accept ip address.
 *
 * "detachedProcess" parameter is passed to spawn() call. In short,
 * if it's true, the client process will be detached from our app, meaning
 * it will not get killed when our app closes. This is intended for
 * online games.
 * In case of local game, we have to kill the server process (otherwise user
 * would have to kill it on his own from task manager), so we might as well
 * kill the client connected to it. In this case, we pass false for "detachedProcess".
 *
 * This function returns the unique identifier of the client being launched.
