/* We only allow one server process to run at a time.
 * It's worth noting that we are responsible for
 * terminating the server process - we don't create
 * any window or shell for server, so users can't really
 * stop the server themselves (except for killing the process,
 * for example from task manager). Luckily for us, processes
 * that are started with spawn() will get killed once our app
 * closes, unless we pass "detached" option to spawn().
 * 
 * The above doesn't seem true for linux... closing the app's window
 * doesn't close child processes, but CTRL+C from terminal seems to
 * work fine... maybe it has to do with the fact that real parent is
 * the terminal window, and not the electron app itself; I don't know...
 * As a workaround, we stop local game manually when the app closes.
